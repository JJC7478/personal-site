    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a Bachelor of Science
        degree in Neuroscience. I am currently seeking an entry-level Research Assistant/Technician position.
        In the past, I served as an undergraduate research assistant under <a href="https://masmanidislab.neurobio.ucla.edu/"
        target="_blank">Dr. Masmanidis</a> with research surrounding corticostriatal neurons and how they affect reward-conditioned
        behavior as well as abberant neural activity in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease. I have
        experience in histology, immunihistochemical staining, and mice handling.
    </p>
    <p>For any inquiries, please email me or contact me through any of the means listed above.</p>
